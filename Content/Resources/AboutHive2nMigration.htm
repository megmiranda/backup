        <h1>Hive 2 and Treasure Data</h1>
        <p>To deliver more of the value of recent Hive developments to Treasure Data customers and offer better capabilities in our long term roadmap, we are introducing new releases based on the Apache Hive 2.x project, alongside our existing Hive 0.13 support. </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>

Using Hive 2.x as a starting point will allow us to build more TD-specific enhancements on a stable, performant foundation, and take advantage of new improvements from the Apache Hive projects, without impacting current customer workloads.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>

Sometimes this document uses the term “Hive 2” to refer to all of TD’s planned new Hive releases in 2019 and 2020. However, we want to avoid using Apache Hive version numbers as our own versions, for several reasons:
</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Our Hive releases may not track exactly the content of specific Apache open source releases. For example, TD Hive 0.13 contains numerous features backported from later Hive releases. It can be misleading to refer to the documentation from a specific Apache Hive release.</li>
            <li>
We plan to use Apache Hive 2.3 as the basis for multiple TD Hive releases in 2019 and 2020. These releases should support the same SQL dialect, but will include major internal enhancements such as the Tez runtime framework, query optimizations, vectorized execution, and more efficient access to data in S3. These improvements will change the behavior of Hive enough that we want new version numbers for them, so customers have an easy way to choose whether to use them. </li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Hive 0.13 Support Alongside Hive 2</h1>
        <p>We believe that our Hive releases in 2019 and 2020 will offer compelling new value so that customers will choose to adopt the newer Hive as their business permits.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Starting to use Hive 2 upon its release for new implementation gets you more of that value sooner. Rewriting existing Hive 0.13 workloads to run in Hive 2 will be required to take advantage of most of the enhancements.</p>
