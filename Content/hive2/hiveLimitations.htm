        <h1>Limitations on Custom Hive and MapReduce Code Support</h1>
        <p>There are limitations on DDL in TD Hive, as there are in TD Presto because of our flexible schema.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Treasure Data limits the use of custom code in our Hadoop and Hive environment because we do not provide dedicated Hive clusters for individual customers.&#160;The following limitations are a result of that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Custom Hive UDFs cannot be added, because these UDFs would be exposed for use by all customers.
            </li>
            <li><a href="../../../../transfer/hive2.docx#Tutorial-Custommap%2Freducescripts">Custom MapReduce scripts</a>&#160;cannot be added due to security and system stability considerations.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Alternatives for running custom code within Arm TD include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>running custom code in Docker containers, see <a href="https://support.treasuredata.com/hc/en-us/articles/360023763634">Custom Scripts</a>.</li>
            <li>running Spark workloads using our TD-Spark capability to access data in the data lake, see <a href="https://support.treasuredata.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020894774">Launcing TD-Spark.</a></li>
        </ul>
