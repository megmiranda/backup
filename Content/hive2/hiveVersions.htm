        <h1><a name="TD"></a>TD Hive 2019.1 and later </h1>
        <li class="ListParagraph_1">Is based on the Hive  releases in active development by the open source community. ANSI compatible, as well as mostly forward compatible with Hive 0.13. We recommend that all new data pipeline and ad hoc Hive workloads run in these releases. These newer releases include many enhancements that significantly enhance your ability to work with your data. For example:</li>
        <ul>
            <li class="ListParagraph_1">stability enhancements</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph_1">improved analysis of query issues </li>
            <li class="ListParagraph_1">query optimizations</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph_1">support for Treasure Data’s user-defined partitioning</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph_1">Tez runtime </li>
            <li class="ListParagraph_1">enterprise data security model</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph_1"> bug fixes from the open source community </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="ListParagraph_1">&#160;</p>
        <p class="p_1">See <a href="https://support.treasuredata.com/hc/en-us/sections/360004643313">upgrading to Hive 2</a> for details on how to clean up your syntax  for a smooth TD Hive 2019 migration. </p>
        <h1><a name="TD2"></a>TD Hive 0.13 </h1>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>A Treasure Data-built release of Hive that backported many features and bug fixes from more recent Hive releases to the 2014 Apache Hive 0.13 release. Hive 0.13 uses HiveQL, a SQL-like query language that is mostly a subset of ANSI SQL, with a few non-standard extensions. TD Hive 0.13 also added some Treasure Data-specific features such as the now-deprecated v[] column syntax.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Continues to be a fully supported Hive release in our environment for the foreseeable future.  However, the open source community no longer provides fixes and enhancements to Hive 0.13, and backporting  updates is impractical because the Hive code base is too different. Therefore we will limit further development and backporting investment in our Hive 0.13-based offering. </p>
