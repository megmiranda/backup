        <p class="p_2">UNIFY and ENRICH</p>
        <p>After connecting to your sources of data, you can unify your data into master segments and use Treasure Data to query your data and create more targeted segments for analysis and campaigns.</p>
        <p><span class="span_1">Data Workbench&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </span>Using the Data Workbench, create master segments of your customer profiles and use the query engine to uncover insights that were previously hidden by the complexity of the data pipeline. Additionally, export your data seamlessly into systems of your choice, such as data science tools, business analytics tools, and CRMs.</p>
        <p><span class="span_1">Audience Studio&#160;&#160;&#160; </span>Using Audience Studio, our marketer-friendly interface, you can gain further insights and prepare data for activation. You can easily view current volume and growth rates of existing master segments as well as view and compare existing segments within a master segment. It allows you to create batch segments from existing master segments and uncover additional insights by leveraging our machine learning through the use of predictive scoring, which will allow you to understand and predict customer behavior more accurately.</p>
        <p class="p_2">ACTIVATE</p>
        <p>After creating a segment based on a specific set of rules, you can export that data through integrations set up in Treasure Data to analytics tools and to activate targeted campaigns such as mobile push notifications, email marketing and website personalization.</p>
