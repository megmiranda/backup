        <p class="p_1">What is a Customer Data Platform?</p>
        <p class="p_2">Treasure Data is a Customer Data Platform (CDP). Understanding what a CDP is and how it works will help you understand more about what Treasure Data can do for your organization. </p>
        <p><span class="span_1">Increasingly, it is becoming important for organization</span><span class="span_1">s</span><span class="span_1"> to keep up with the technology that allows them to understand who their customers are</span><span class="span_1"> by leveraging the organizations’ stores of customer data</span><span class="span_1">. Technology can be used to create better customer experiences, but the problem is that organizations have their data in many locations and no way to unify that data across the organization’s </span><span class="span_1">various data silos</span><span class="span_1">. A Customer Data Platform </span><span class="span_1">provides the</span><span class="span_1"> organization </span><span class="span_1">with a solution to</span><span class="span_1"> this problem. </span>
        </p>
        <p><span class="span_1">What is a Customer Data Platform? According to the CDP Institute, “a Customer Data Platform is packaged software that creates a persistent, unified customer database that is accessible to other systems.” In addition to gathering customer profile data, it is also a place to gather data that impacts customers as well</span><span class="span_1"> and then allows the organization to use that data to create a more personalized experience for each of their customers.</span>

        <p><span class="span_1">The </span><span class="span_2">Customer Data Platform </span><span class="span_1">allows you to pull </span><span class="span_1">in your </span><span class="span_2">1</span><sup class="sup_1">st</sup><span class="span_2"> Party Data,</span><span class="span_1"> which is </span><span class="span_1">all of</span><span class="span_1"> the data your organization owns such as POS data, ERP data, web logs, and social data,</span> <span class="span_1">in to one place</span><span class="span_1">. </span><span class="span_1">The CDP can also connect with your organization’s </span><span class="span_2">channels</span><span class="span_1"> such as your website, CRM, and social media which are additional sources of data, but also opportunities for activation of campaigns.</span></p>
        <p><span class="span_1">In addition, you can ingest </span><span class="span_2">2</span><sup class="sup_1">nd</sup><span class="span_2"> and </span><span class="span_2">3</span><sup class="sup_1">rd</sup> <span class="span_2">party data</span><span class="span_1"> which affects your customers such as demographic info, weather, occupation and income.</span></p>
        <p><span class="span_1">Being able to ingest your company data and your channel data into a unified place as well as then activating campaigns back out through your channels allows you to understand the customer as they move through the </span><span class="span_2">customer lifecycle </span><span class="span_1">and personalize that journey. This </span><span class="span_1">will help</span><span class="span_1"> you orchestrate an enhanced customer journey </span><span class="span_1">all the way </span><span class="span_1">from awareness to advocacy.</span>
